      <!--Game History-->
      <td id=tdleft>Valorant is a first-person shooter video game that was officially released on June 2,
        2020. It was
        done under Riot Games, the creators of games such as League of Legends. Riot Games’ vision for Valorant is a
        free to play FPS game that caters to both new and professional players. The development of the game started in
        2014 and it is still under development and management until today. Developers who were previously from games
        such as Counter-strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2, and Gears of War 4 were part of the team
        that worked on the game’s map, agent, and engine design making some of these games’ influences evident
        throughout the game. Valorant was developed through Unreal Engine 4. This enabled Riot to focus more on the
        game’s features and settings. To cater to a large playerbase, Riot set Valorant’s minimum hardware requirements
        quite low. Another of their optimizations to meet this expectation was setting the games servers to 128-tick.
        Unfortunately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, this was not too effective with the large increase in internet
        traffic which caused players worldwide to experience connection issues (Wikipedia contributors, 2022).</td>
      <!--Game's Current State-->
      <td id=tdright>
        Ever since Valorant’s release on June 2, 2022 Riot Games have released 4 maps and 9 agents. The most recent map
        is Pearl alongside Fade, Valorant’s newest agent. Riot Games organized Valorant Champions Tour which was
        Valorant’s tournament series. They have had two VCT seasons so far, one for 2021 and one for 2022 which ended
        recently on September 18, 2022. Valorant’s number of active players each month continues to grow
        and with its current state it does not seem like halting anytime soon (Wikipedia contributors, 2022b).

      Split is a map located in the district Shinjiku of Tokyo, Japan. This map was included in the game’s beta version
      and was also included in the game’s official release. It also was the first map to have climbable rope features.
      However, it was recently removed from core game modes, such as competitive and unrated, making Split only
      accessible through custom game modes.

      Icebox is the 1st map to be added after the first release of the game but is also the 6th map out of the total 9
      maps today. This map also featured special horizontal ziplines for the first time which revolutionized movement
      and provided neon users with trick shots. These horizontal ziplines can also be found on another map named
      Fracture. This map also features rope ascenders found in Split and Breeze.

    <!--Haven Short Description-->
    <div class="haven-middle-right">

      Haven is one of the four maps released during the Valorant's launch. It features three sites, which is why it was refered to with the code "triad" during its development. These sites contain various obstacles that test the player's versatility when it comes to different heights. Due to this, Haven became a popular map for the movement agent Raze.

    <div class="bind-middle-right">

      Bind is one of the early released maps during the Beta testing. It is also the first and only map to feature the
      concept of teleportation between sites. However, a recent update by Riot Games has removed Bind from unrated and
      competitive matchmaking as they optimize the gameplay on this map, and make them fairer for the attacker and
      defender sides.

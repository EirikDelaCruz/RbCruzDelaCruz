    <tr>
      <td id=histleft>Valorant is a first-person shooter video game that was officially released on June 2,
        2020. It was
        done under Riot Games, the creators of games such as League of Legends. Riot Games’ vision for Valorant is a
        free to play FPS game that caters to both new and professional players. The development of the game started in
        2014 and it is still under development and management until today. Developers who were previously from games
        such as Counter-strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2, and Gears of War 4 were part of the team
        that worked on the game’s map, agent, and engine design making some of these games’ influences evident
        throughout the game. Valorant was developed through Unreal Engine 4. This enabled Riot to focus more on the
        game’s features and settings. To cater to a large playerbase, Riot set Valorant’s minimum hardware requirements
        quite low. Another of their optimizations to meet this expectation was setting the games servers to 128-tick.
        Unfortunately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, this was not too effective with the large increase in internet
        traffic which caused players worldwide to experience connection issues (Wikipedia contributors, 2022).</td>
      <td id=curright>
        Ever since Valorant’s release on June 2, 2022 Riot Games have released 4 maps and 9 agents. The most recent map
        is Pearl alongside Fade, Valorant’s newest agent. Riot Games organized Valorant Champions Tour which was
        Valorant’s tournament series. They have had two VCT seasons so far, one for 2021 and one for 2022 which ended
        recently on September 18, 2022 (insert source). Valorant’s number of active players each month continues to grow
        and with its current state it does not seem like halting anytime soon (Wikipedia contributors, 2022b).

      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
      type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
      remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
      of Lorem Ipsum.

      Icebox is the 1st map to be added after the first release of the game but is also the 6th map out of the total 9
      maps today. This map also featured special horizontal ziplines for the first time which revolutionized movement
      and provided neon users with trick shots. These horizontal ziplines can also be found on another map named
      Fracture. This map also features rope ascenders found in Split and Breeze.

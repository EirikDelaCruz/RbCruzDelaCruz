TITLE OF THE WEBPAGE: Eirik and Milo’s Favorite Valorant Maps

SHORT DESCRIPTION

HOMEPAGE (will be submitted this quarter)
The homepage will display a short description of Valorant, a game created by Riot Games. An array of images will be displayed across the screen. These images would show Valorant's game maps. Short descriptions of the map would be placed alongside the images. These images would link to web pages about the maps. A short history of the game, including its development, early stages, and current state, will be displayed in the middle part of the page. References and other information will be provided at the footer.
